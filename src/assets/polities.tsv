Larnax	Republic of Tantalus		The Republic of Tantalus is most prosperous state on Larnax, one of the four states to emerge out of the collapse of the old Larnax Colonial Government. Centered around the capital city of Romi Bay and the (at the time) partially completed orbital elevator sited at the mouth of the Tantalus Chasm the future republic simply closed its borders and rode out the worst of the troubles. Having long had a significant UN presence due to the Larnax Junction and consequently little need or desire for local warfleets, the successor governments on Larnax all tacitly agreed on a policy that amounted to 'duck and cover'. While excroriated as cowards by some of the more virulent anti-UN groups, many of them were soon taking orbitally-dropped PGMs into presidential palaces.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-suns-space-empire-game.857793/post-67866891
Azania	People's Democratic Federation of Azania		Azania is a major player in the Verge. Its fleet of 'patrol' ships and cruisers patrol the spacelanes to protect its expansive merchant marine and those of other nations. Despite its industrial and economic power, Azania is a state that lives and dies based on trade and access to markets. It needs to import food even with operational agricultural habitats, and needs to export finished goods and rare materials to pay for that food. The state itself, the People's Democratic Federation of Azania, is a Democratic Confederalist state of communes, wards, and stations that work together for the betterment of one another. Azania's foreign policy extends this idea of cooperation and tolerance to the stars: Azanians are perfectly happy to make friends with everyone and help the helpless, and are generally distasteful of conquerors or imperialists; they're also perfectly willing to lumber into a fight swinging, and then put both sides under their stewardship for everyone's well being.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-suns-space-empire-game.857793/post-67869162

Arta	League of Independant Fleets		The League is ruled by a shadow League Council that consists of majority of fleet admirals, less ground generals, and then fewer wealthy merchants. The League Council makes all the decisions. Its members then maintain control over strong top-down hierarchies - corporations, armies, fleets. Further, a puppet League Assembly is tasked with putting up a public face of participatory government. It consists of almost 200 nominally autonomous entities (beholden to members of the Council in fact). But while the Shadow Fleet, for example, is theoretically its own entity with theoretically its own regulations, overlaying them over those of the Arta Station will reveal 99% agreement with those of another nominally independent entity.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-suns-space-empire-game.857793/post-67877379
Freehold	The Freehold Coalition and the Enlisted Fleet		Freehold and the Enlisted Fleet have kept their idealism and ethos intact even after the founders long passed. The concept of a commissioned officer corps is gone, replaced with a military that demands every soldier work from the bottom up. The economic market has been kept in check with AI-governed and enforced regulation and planning to ensure the corporate excesses of the past would not be repeated. Much of this helped by the UN ongoing branding Freehold as a rogue state, with frequent reminders of what defeat at the hands of the UN's now autonomous fleets may do directing the fears and motivation of Freehold as it has pursued efforts to salvage the Disrupted worlds and topple brutal dictatorships.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-suns-space-empire-game.857793/post-67881468
Novopol	Greater Visegrad Union		The Union is a mostly democratic entity, with its own planetary parliament known as Prezydium that consists of representatives from each Administrative District. They are known as Elektors, for this very Prezydium also elects for a period of five years a Konsul to preside over the body and perform administrative decisions as the Head of Government. That person does not enjoy total control over the executive, however. Since Novopol had been a closely overseen colony for a very long time it still maintains many meritocratic traditions and far stronger institutions that used to be the only source of law and order, and accordingly members of his or her cabinet are chosen from a premade list of people considered to be well experienced and competent in the relevant field. According to Novopolan beliefs, elected officials are there to give direction to the Union, one as closely resembling the wishes of its people as possible.

Many of the habitats were occupied during the opening phase of the war by the Rosalindians for use as supply bases for their offensive onward to Rafel and Navalon and to use their immense resource gathering potential for their own war effort.

Spaceports were expanded and the population grew at a booming pace. With time this influence brought the planet into a crisis. It was related to the destruction of a UN ship by the High Admiralty because of suspicion of it being a pirate ship in camouflage. This was used by the two corporations to propose the dismantling of the admiralty and the navy, instead of extending their hands to the UN to take over the planet.

Fairchild	Inheritors of Ussela		Fairchild belongs to the Inheritors- priests of the machine- who say that the Outsiders built it to save Fairchild’s alien host from an ancient disaster by imprinting their minds in a vast digital afterlife, a place where life, death and time became irrelevant. The Inheritors have unearthed parts of this device, placing them in ships and in cities, purportedly to collect the mindstates of the dead at the time of their passing and convey them unto a digital heaven. To the layperson it would seem like superstition and nonsense, except that, occasionally, a soul of the departed returns from the machine in a gilded synthetic shell, all of its worldly knowledge and experience intact.

New California	The People’s States of America		In the decades leading up to the collapse, tensions between America and its most far-flung colonies had nearly reached a boiling point. Citizens of what was known as the American Diaspora were sick and tired of oppressive and exploitative economic practices. Nearly a millennia after the American revolution, the second American Revolution erupted in the fires of the Disconnect. The colonies declared independence, one by one, over the course of two short months. The United States Space Force had been a paper tiger for years, albeit a large one. The rebellious colonials would have stood no chance if it were not for the simultaneous revolt of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force. While other fringe worlds dissolved into anarchy, the newly formed People’s States of America engaged in a crash-militarization program of epic proportions. Even so, the first battle of the PSA against their former colonial masters was a bloodbath. The People’s navy consisted of ramshackle escorts, barely even manned because of how shoddily constructed they were, and ore haulers with lasers and armor bolted on. The United States of America had the USSFV George Washington as the centerpiece of its fleet – a capital ship that outweighed and outgunned every single ship in the rebel navy. The US Navy shattered dozens of PSA hulls – but it wasn’t enough. Through force of numbers and sheer bloody-minded fanaticism, the newly formed Socialist state won the day. The American navy, already broken from its conflict with the UN, turned tail and headed home. And thus, from the ashes, was born a new nation. Dedicated to the principles that all men are created equal, and liberty and justice for all – for real this time.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-suns-space-empire-game.857793/post-68074003

New Acre	The Order of Knights Templar		As earth expanded her colonies and humanity reached out for the stars, it didn’t take long for problematic elements to emerge. While the UN fleet was able to handle most of the worst pirates and raiders, they were areas that didn’t receive attention either for being too remote or too politically divisive for a political body to operate in. As a result, some of the colonies in these areas languished in lawlessness. The situation gained the attention of the Catholic Church who decided to act. Leveraging its vast assets and influence it called upon willing colonists and faithful soldiers to join the waves of settlers and bring the fires of faith to the stars. Such fires would bring light and warmth to the oppressed, but also destruction to the wicked. It revived an ancient order, one dedicated to protecting travelers and the weak in the Holy Land.

Paradise	The Pary Deza		The Pary Deza of the mid-twenty-eighth century is a total state, which every aspect of life directed by an enormous bureaucracy according to precisely compiled and continually updated actuarial tables, cost matricies, and even eugenical programs. Each citizen surrenders their genome to the state as a matter of course, receiving in return every possible (state-acknolwedged) need, including housing, education, personal effects, work, and a variety of cost-effecient entertainments and social settings. Registered children are birthed in huge state-run hatcheries according to government-run plans, and housed and educated in boarding complexes alongside the unregistered issue of privately-arranged romantic liaisons. As there is no concept of "household" beyond state-run civic organizations at the village/complex level, nor any significant personal property or marriage, such liaisons are conducted according strictly to free-love or informal barter arrangement principles. While external observers often consider the Deza a psychotic mass prison or inscrutable headless post-totalitarianism, the standard of living is generally high, and Dezans report a reasonable level of satisfiaction with both the material and immaterial sides of life. Critics point out, of course, that not only all education and entertainment but also all polling and statistics are produced purely by the Dezan state itself, and the argument invariably ends--or devolves from--there.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-suns-space-empire-game.857793/post-68328664

Arriving more or less peacefully in the system, they quickly established themselves in the holdings they had on planet and waged a war of dominance on the planet, putting down rivaling powers on the planet until finally a semblance of order came out of the fires of chaos that had gripped the planet for decades. With the First Interstellar War having finished years ago, merchant ships had also begun to ply the routes once again. The primary reason they never really came back to Shilo was that the planet was locked in a conflict between powers.

In the ensuing years the Edwards rebuilt the city-states of the Northern Continent into an industrial and scientific powerhouse through the use of more questionable economic interactions with various corporations and off-world assets.

Oblivia	Republic of Oblivia		Oblivia is a marginally habitable Earthlike world orbiting a dwarf star of about 0.3 solar masses, founded in the first wave mostly by then-libertarian volunteers from Earth who expected that distance would keep them out from under the thumb of national or corporate interests. For a time it worked, with Oblivia holding the title of furthest-flung colony for two or three generations. With little support its development was slow, though it did eventually become a fully independent statelet living up to modest expectations, whirling alone out in the deep frontier. It enjoyed some praise as a model colony, ruling a vast ocean of untamed worlds. As extra-solar colonization continued though, Oblivia's isolation was eroded. Colonies with more resources soon appeared nearby, outgrowing and outcompeting the mature world. Trade was naturally well-received, but with commerce and population came both the unwanted attention of raiders and the United Nations. There was no longer any defence in distance alone, and the world underwent several upheavals as violence and outside politics were soon on its doorstep.	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SyNy_jrMg5ZVo1YVteAaaU6ZKizuFPwrMkslWbio_5M/edit#

Refusing to take even itself seriously, Outer Oblivia didn't command enough respect to be reigned in or supported by its parent world, which seemed to delight in its missteps and struggles. Its early years were marked by turmoil with radical shifts in government as it experimented with one form after another. Generations later, though, it found a footing and things changed. Where Oblivia spurned the slow encroachment of civilization on what was then the Frontier, the Supreme Ascendency embraced it. Situated in orbit around a superjovian world with one hundred moons and a metallic asteroid ring, Outer Oblivia had a preponderance of resources and ideal shipbuilding sites, and soon became an important industrial center and a nexus for growth as colonies expanded both around it and into the untamed expanse beyond it.	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SyNy_jrMg5ZVo1YVteAaaU6ZKizuFPwrMkslWbio_5M/edit#

That possibility falls to his daughter, Elisabet Arnau, who seems far more ambitious but somewhat less able to rein the vassals in through fear and punishment.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-stars-2749-ic-thread-ending-year-moving-into-year-2.861199/post-68590336
Robin	Robin		Colonized shortly before the Disconnect, Robin's thick atmosphere and mountainous terraces lent itself to high altitude villages, nourished by abundant glaciers. The locals settled with long-term self-sufficiency in mind and produced few exports, only starting to re-orient towards the outside world after recontact by nearby Stavanger. Most economic activity is based on seeding the terraces and valleys with transgenic forests that are harvested sustainably for a boutique export market, with an eye towards eventually producing great redwoods and mangrove trees that can be used to stabilize the humid, rainy lowlands of the planet's limited habitable land. The serene beauty and calm seasons drew a more introspective and less enterprising sort of colonist in early days, with including a permanent hermitage of the Society of Analytical Philosophy, followed by a number of new-age sects and self-improvement movements after the return of space travel.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-stars-2749-ic-thread-ending-year-moving-into-year-2.861199/post-68667274
Virtue	Virtue		Originally calling their colony 'El Dorado', the local wildcat miners were forced to change the name after being sued by the actual Dorado government when they finally incorporated. What the planet lacked in mineral diversity or a useable biosphere, it made up in sheer abnormal amounts of gold- still a useful component in low-corrosion electronics, particularly in various high-precision alloys. High yearly production and a reliable export market ensured a very low gold price for many long years before Disconnect, eventually drawing the attention of traditional craftsmen from across old Earth. Religious authorities from India and Southeast Asia, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, took it upon themselves to settle local merchants and artisans who could take advantage of cheap prices to produce high-purity gold handiworks for the interstellar faithful.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-stars-2749-ic-thread-ending-year-moving-into-year-2.861199/post-68667274

Octagon	Octagon		The Octagon Cartel is one of the largest corporate entities in the Verge, representing an enormous consolidated block with hundreds of subsidiaries. Originally little more than a pirate outfit, large stock of bullion, a few crypto-miners and significantly more ruthless practices than their rivals allowed them to launder their origins and use the confusion of Disconnect to reestablish as a legitimate house of trade. After a generation of conquests, the new Cartel leadership were able administrators who consolidated control and moved the organization to a promising planet with vast growth potential. Octagon, an exotic gas giant with diffuse gravity and a semi-habitable upper atmosphere and several atmosphere-bearing moons, was made their seat of power through years of politicking, buyouts and outright violence.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-stars-2750-year-3.861199/post-69596713
Neue Lichtenstein	Neue Lichtenstein		A sleepy collection of captured asteroids, lashed together with mega-structural struts and enclosed inside of a bubble, the Duchy of Neue Lichtenstein is a minor self-governing state along the inner periphery of the verge. The extended habitat is roughly the size of Iceland in its total surface area, consisting of interlocking spingrav hubs and microgravity homes built into hollowed-out asteroids with a flair towards 18th century central European revivalism that has given the nation the moniker of 'Alps Without Gravity'. The sprawling interior is a finely tuned machine with the spingrav segments counter-rotating precisely to induce minimal stress on the superstructure, a clockwork world inside a bubble. The ruling Duke Albretch von Neue Lichtenstein is an ailing man beloved by his people, with two generations of successors well-integrated into his public image and poised for the limelight, particularly his grand-niece Marisela.	https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruins-of-alien-stars-2750-year-3.861199/post-70068024
