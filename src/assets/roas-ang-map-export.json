Azania's foreign policy extends this idea of cooperation and tolerance to the stars: Azanians are perfectly happy to make friends with everyone and help the helpless, and are generally distasteful of conquerors or imperialists; they're also perfectly willing to lumber into a fight swinging, and then put both sides under their stewardship for everyone's well being.",

Created from seed money of several eccentric tech billionaires on a quest to create their own perfect ideal society ended up taking a darker tone as the colonial leaders had far more transhuman ideology than they told the colonists. While rumors had swirled about some of the more unethical nature of their human experimentation the colony backers were wealthy enough to keep the UN Fleet away inspecting it. During the Disconnect, with the need of secrecy no longer needed, Praetoria announced the creation of the Ascendancy and had during the follow time period conquered and invaded the nearby systems of Dis and New Bangkok, the later of which prompted the UN to slap them with sanctions and embargo. Today Praetoria is slowly being terraformed into an Earth-like world with self-contained arcology cities built both above and below the surface like techno mushrooms dotting the world, with an increasingly overriding genetic caste system.",

It was supposed to remain a mining colony and nothing more than that, even in the infrastructure budget for the Istrelpia was limited and the domes around the mining centers were built to last only around two hundred years, however, with each passing year. The geological survey teams sent to Istrelpia by the UN reported more and more mineral veins that further fueled a \"Mining Rush\" to the planet. Spaceports were expanded and the population grew at a booming pace. With time this influence brought the planet into a crisis. It was related to the destruction of a UN ship by the High Admiralty because of suspicion of it being a pirate ship in camouflage. This was used by the two corporations to propose the dismantling of the admiralty and the navy, instead of extending their hands to the UN to take over the planet. Many believed that this had been plotted by the corporations and the admiralty resisted fiercely. Bringing about the execution of the high corporate hierarchy and the establishment of a militaristic system of government. A quite popular one that soon spread throughout the rest of the nation, it brought about both good and bad changes, but enough of the good kind to turn the population for the Authority government now in place.\r\n",

It was supposed to remain a mining colony and nothing more than that, even in the infrastructure budget for the Istrelpia was limited and the domes around the mining centers were built to last only around two hundred years, however, with each passing year. The geological survey teams sent to Istrelpia by the UN reported more and more mineral veins that further fueled a \"Mining Rush\" to the planet. Spaceports were expanded and the population grew at a booming pace. With time this influence brought the planet into a crisis. It was related to the destruction of a UN ship by the High Admiralty because of suspicion of it being a pirate ship in camouflage. This was used by the two corporations to propose the dismantling of the admiralty and the navy, instead of extending their hands to the UN to take over the planet. Many believed that this had been plotted by the corporations and the admiralty resisted fiercely. Bringing about the execution of the high corporate hierarchy and the establishment of a militaristic system of government. A quite popular one that soon spread throughout the rest of the nation, it brought about both good and bad changes, but enough of the good kind to turn the population for the Authority government now in place.\r\n",

Citizens of what was known as the American Diaspora were sick and tired of oppressive and exploitative economic practices. Nearly a millennia after the American revolution, the second American Revolution erupted in the fires of the Disconnect.

While other fringe worlds dissolved into anarchy, the newly formed People’s States of America engaged in a crash-militarization program of epic proportions. Even so, the first battle of the PSA against their former colonial masters was a bloodbath. The People’s navy consisted of ramshackle escorts, barely even manned because of how shoddily constructed they were, and ore haulers with lasers and armor bolted on. The United States of America had the USSFV George Washington as the centerpiece of its fleet – a capital ship that outweighed and outgunned every single ship in the rebel navy. The US Navy shattered dozens of PSA hulls – but it wasn’t enough. Through force of numbers and sheer bloody-minded fanaticism, the newly formed Socialist state won the day. The American navy, already broken from its conflict with the UN, turned tail and headed home. And thus, from the ashes, was born a new nation.

Originally meant to project Solar power across the Inner Colonies so as to free up more experienced fleets for the Verge, Task Force Maria proved itself to be far more effective than expected under Rear Admiral Cochrane. In light of this fact, UN Fleet Command started assigning the Task Force more and more important assignments, as well as seeing fit for it to have the best equipment available. This culminated in its deployment in the Subjugation of Cygnia, when they refused to comply with UN Armament Regulations. During this operation, Task Force Maria was stationed in orbit to ensure that no illegal armaments were to be smuggled off world during the UN invasion, where it accomplished its mission by eliminating all spacecrafts leaving the planet, including ones that were clearly civilian. Cochrane avoided a court martial by the skin of his teeth, saved only by the fact that one of the ships shot down was indeed found to be containing biological weapons, and that the UN Fleet was already stretched thin. Instead, he, along with his fleet, would be assigned further away from Earth, where he would be tasked with the acquisition of alien technology, as well as to further Solar and UN interests in the Verge, whatever they may be.",

Rummies circulated that the group had even been funded and operated by the UNint. This earned the company ire but also significant credits. The company expanded fast and spread into R&D and exploration but eventually their past came back to them. Evidence of crimes committed on a colony world surfaced and this was used by the UN HighComm to outlaw the rouge company, some suspect the motives was in a power play against what they saw as the ambitions of the Inteligence agency. Most of the extensive Fleet and Army of the operation simply laid down their guns; they were hired to fight pirates not their own government. However a small group of the companies most elite enforcer cadre and their leaders escaped with a series of high tech vessels and much of the companies R&D staff.

Citizens of what was known as the American Diaspora were sick and tired of oppressive and exploitative economic practices. Nearly a millennia after the American revolution, the second American Revolution erupted in the fires of the Disconnect. The colonies declared independence, one by one, over the course of two short months. The United States Space Force had been a paper tiger for years, albeit a large one. The rebellious colonials would have stood no chance if it were not for the simultaneous revolt of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force. While other fringe worlds dissolved into anarchy, the newly formed People’s States of America engaged in a crash-militarization program of epic proportions. Even so, the first battle of the PSA against their former colonial masters was a bloodbath. The People’s navy consisted of ramshackle escorts, barely even manned because of how shoddily constructed they were, and ore haulers with lasers and armor bolted on. The United States of America had the USSFV George Washington as the centerpiece of its fleet – a capital ship that outweighed and outgunned every single ship in the rebel navy. The US Navy shattered dozens of PSA hulls – but it wasn’t enough. Through force of numbers and sheer bloody-minded fanaticism, the newly formed Socialist state won the day. The American navy, already broken from its conflict with the UN, turned tail and headed home. And thus, from the ashes, was born a new nation. Dedicated to the principles that all men are created equal, and liberty and justice for all – for real this time.",

As there is no concept of \"household\" beyond state-run civic organizations at the village/complex level, nor any significant personal property or marriage, such liaisons are conducted according strictly to free-love or informal barter arrangement principles. While external observers often consider the Deza a psychotic mass prison or inscrutable headless post-totalitarianism, the standard of living is generally high, and Dezans report a reasonable level of satisfaction with both the material and immaterial sides of life. Critics point out, of course, that not only all education and entertainment but also all polling and statistics are produced purely by the Dezan state itself, and the argument invariably ends--or devolves from--there.",

For a time it worked, with Oblivia holding the title of furthest-flung colony for two or three generations. With little support its development was slow, though it did eventually become a fully independent statelet living up to modest expectations, whirling alone out in the deep frontier. It enjoyed some praise as a model colony, ruling a vast ocean of untamed worlds. As extra-solar colonization continued though, Oblivia's isolation was eroded. Colonies with more resources soon appeared nearby, outgrowing and out-competing the mature world. Trade was naturally well-received, but with commerce and population came both the unwanted attention of raiders and the United Nations. There was no longer any defence in distance alone, and the world underwent several upheavals as violence and outside politics were soon on its doorstep.",

Refusing to take even itself seriously, Outer Oblivia didn't command enough respect to be reigned in or supported by its parent world, which seemed to delight in its missteps and struggles. Its early years were marked by turmoil with radical shifts in government as it experimented with one form after another. Generations later, though, it found a footing and things changed. Where Oblivia spurned the slow encroachment of civilization on what was then the Frontier, the Supreme Ascendancy embraced it. Situated in orbit around a super-jovian world with one hundred moons and a metallic asteroid ring, Outer Oblivia had a preponderance of resources and ideal shipbuilding sites, and soon became an important industrial center and a nexus for growth as colonies expanded both around it and into the untamed expanse beyond it.",

Originally meant to project Solar power across the Inner Colonies so as to free up more experienced fleets for the Verge, Task Force Maria proved itself to be far more effective than expected under Rear Admiral Cochrane. In light of this fact, UN Fleet Command started assigning the Task Force more and more important assignments, as well as seeing fit for it to have the best equipment available. This culminated in its deployment in the Subjugation of Cygnia, when they refused to comply with UN Armament Regulations. During this operation, Task Force Maria was stationed in orbit to ensure that no illegal armaments were to be smuggled off world during the UN invasion, where it accomplished its mission by eliminating all spacecrafts leaving the planet, including ones that were clearly civilian. Cochrane avoided a court martial by the skin of his teeth, saved only by the fact that one of the ships shot down was indeed found to be containing biological weapons, and that the UN Fleet was already stretched thin.

The founder preached that all humanity should work together in order for the betterment of all.  The cult first emerged in India, but spread quickly among the Indian diaspora, New Age movements in North America, Europe, and East Asia on Earth as well as the people of certain colony worlds such as Shinjoseon. There are followers of the Temple in many parts of human space, all of whom are considered citizens if they desire to visit, and many of whom support the colony from afar. The Temple considers the colony to be a showpiece to show the galaxy that humanity can be enlightened. Contact with spacefaring alien species who view humans as a dangerous animal has only strengthened the resolve of the Universalists.",

Interstellar expansion presented the opportunity to seed the solar system with French culture and so the Voyageurs were formed to seek out new homelands.  After a suitable planet was found, the colonists decided to sell off their exploration craft in order to provide for the fledgling colony. Many of the Voyageurs took a liking to spaceborne life and were able to pool enough money together to buy the assets outright. Ever since, they have sold their services as surveyors and explorers.  As their numbers grew and Voyageurs retired or tired of their lives, the need for a colony to call their own grew. Their base of operations has grown into a fully fledged planet. Luckily as renowned surveyors, the task was relatively easy and a small base of operations grew into a substantial colony. The dominant language is Canadian French and the government is strictly atheist.",
