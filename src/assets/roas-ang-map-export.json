Ironically news about the Survey Corps’s perfidy had caused the reforms that allowed van der Graff to obtain centralized power. During the Disconnect the system was able to weather the storm relying off a bought off UN Task Force which became their system military after the defeat of the mutiny.

Its early years were marked by turmoil with radical shifts in government as it experimented with one form after another. Generations later, though, it found a footing and things changed. Where Oblivia spurned the slow encroachment of civilization on what was then the Frontier, the Supreme Ascendancy embraced it. Situated in orbit around a super-jovian world with one hundred moons and a metallic asteroid ring, Outer Oblivia had a preponderance of resources and ideal shipbuilding sites, and soon became an important industrial center and a nexus for growth as colonies expanded both around it and into the untamed expanse beyond it.",

As a result, some of the colonies in these areas languished in lawlessness. The situation gained the attention of the Catholic Church who decided to act. Leveraging its vast assets and influence it called upon willing colonists and faithful soldiers to join the waves of settlers and bring the fires of faith to the stars. Such fires would bring light and warmth to the oppressed, but also destruction to the wicked. It revived an ancient order, one dedicated to protecting travelers and the weak in the Holy Land.

While the UN fleet was able to handle most of the worst pirates and raiders, they were areas that didn’t receive attention either for being too remote or too politically divisive for a political body to operate in. As a result, some of the colonies in these areas languished in lawlessness. The situation gained the attention of the Catholic Church who decided to act. Leveraging its vast assets and influence it called upon willing colonists and faithful soldiers to join the waves of settlers and bring the fires of faith to the stars. Such fires would bring light and warmth to the oppressed, but also destruction to the wicked. It revived an ancient order, one dedicated to protecting travelers and the weak in the Holy Land. The new experiment was dubbed, the Knights Templar.",

The disconnect hit the early Commonwealth only moderately hard and they spent more time fending off corporate takeover attempts and incursions by their neighbors which forged the Commonwealth into a more concrete whole that withstood the test of time.",

Ironically news about the Survey Corps’s perfidy had caused the reforms that allowed van der Graff to obtain centralized power. During the Disconnect the system was able to weather the storm relying off a bought off UN Task Force which became their system military after the defeat of the mutiny. Aldebaran is unique in that it has no centralized planet that is settlement but in fact is civilization of rockhopppers and miners and pleasure stations arranged in a giant ring around the star. It is “known” that the Sultanate is the primer place for black market goods, PMCs, or fenced goods as its in system police looks the other way at piracy in system. In common parlance, when goes to Aldebaran they either go to the Gold Ring which is where the pleasure stations are or, the Shadow Ring where pirate stations and hidden bases are.",

While rumors had swirled about some of the more unethical nature of their human experimentation the colony backers were wealthy enough to keep the UN Fleet away inspecting it. During the Disconnect, with the need of secrecy no longer needed, Praetoria announced the creation of the Ascendancy and had during the follow time period conquered and invaded the nearby systems of Dis and New Bangkok, the later of which prompted the UN to slap them with sanctions and embargo.

Spaceports were expanded and the population grew at a booming pace. With time this influence brought the planet into a crisis. It was related to the destruction of a UN ship by the High Admiralty because of suspicion of it being a pirate ship in camouflage. This was used by the two corporations to propose the dismantling of the admiralty and the navy, instead of extending their hands to the UN to take over the planet. Many believed that this had been plotted by the corporations and the admiralty resisted fiercely.

The League Council makes all the decisions. Its members then maintain control over strong top-down hierarchies - corporations, armies, fleets.

It consists of almost 200 nominally autonomous entities (beholden to members of the Council in fact). But while the Shadow Fleet, for example, is theoretically its own entity with theoretically its own regulations, overlaying them over those of the Arta Station will reveal 99% agreement with those of another nominally independent entity.",

        "description" : "Oblivia is a marginally habitable Earth-like world orbiting a dwarf star of about 0.3 solar masses, founded in the first wave mostly by then-libertarian volunteers from Earth who expected that distance would keep them out from under the thumb of national or corporate interests. For a time it worked, with Oblivia holding the title of furthest-flung colony for two or three generations. With little support its development was slow, though it did eventually become a fully independent statelet living up to modest expectations, whirling alone out in the deep frontier. It enjoyed some praise as a model colony, ruling a vast ocean of untamed worlds. As extra-solar colonization continued though, Oblivia's isolation was eroded. Colonies with more resources soon appeared nearby, outgrowing and out-competing the mature world. Trade was naturally well-received, but with commerce and population came both the unwanted attention of raiders and the United Nations. There was no longer any defence in distance alone, and the world underwent several upheavals as violence and outside politics were soon on its doorstep.",

Refusing to take even itself seriously, Outer Oblivia didn't command enough respect to be reigned in or supported by its parent world, which seemed to delight in its missteps and struggles. Its early years were marked by turmoil with radical shifts in government as it experimented with one form after another. Generations later, though, it found a footing and things changed. Where Oblivia spurned the slow encroachment of civilization on what was then the Frontier, the Supreme Ascendancy embraced it. Situated in orbit around a super-jovian world with one hundred moons and a metallic asteroid ring, Outer Oblivia had a preponderance of resources and ideal shipbuilding sites, and soon became an important industrial center and a nexus for growth as colonies expanded both around it and into the untamed expanse beyond it.",

Perhaps the most prominent or notable of these \"second wave\" or \"latecomer\" groups would be the sizable contingent of Japanese miners that were brought in by one of the mega-corps to mine the system for resources. Unfortunately, the Disconnect was a massive disaster for the planet that the local authorities, the so-called Confederation of Karth, were ill-equipped to handle. Fighting broke out among the different factions, triggering a local war that was eventually won by one \"insert name here\" who proceeded to reforge Karthian society to fit his idealized vision of a well ordered and noble society. He established the authoritarian and nationalistic monarchy that rules over Karth to this day. Though it is technically a constitutional monarchy, the monarchy possess a great deal of power along with the House of Lords within the National Legislative Assembly. The House of Commons is far from powerless, for example they must approve the creation of any new heritable titles, it is clear who the top dogs are.",

This led to a brutal guerrilla war which eventually horrified the SSAR's public enough to cut their own mercenary troops free, but also caused a political crisis in many of the other Beta Continental cities as to how to deal with both marauding off-worlder and SSAR troops, and the flood of refugees created by the conflict. This in turn, resulted in the anarcho-socialist \"Councils of Workers and Intellectuals\" which had been one of the more successful intercity groups to take power, forming a state around a combination of direct, computer-aided democracy and worker and expert controlled councils. The UCCT became a major force in the defeat of the mercenaries, and in the post-war negotiation and skirmishing was able to muscle the SSAR back to ts pre-war limits.",

While the UN fleet was able to handle most of the worst pirates and raiders, they were areas that didn’t receive attention either for being too remote or too politically divisive for a political body to operate in. As a result, some of the colonies in these areas languished in lawlessness. The situation gained the attention of the Catholic Church who decided to act. Leveraging its vast assets and influence it called upon willing colonists and faithful soldiers to join the waves of settlers and bring the fires of faith to the stars. Such fires would bring light and warmth to the oppressed, but also destruction to the wicked. It revived an ancient order, one dedicated to protecting travelers and the weak in the Holy Land.

Each citizen surrenders their genome to the state as a matter of course, receiving in return every possible (state-acknowledged) need, including housing, education, personal effects, work, and a variety of cost-efficient entertainments and social settings. Registered children are birthed in huge state-run hatcheries according to government-run plans, and housed and educated in boarding complexes alongside the unregistered issue of privately-arranged romantic liaisons. As there is no concept of \"household\" beyond state-run civic organizations at the village/complex level, nor any significant personal property or marriage, such liaisons are conducted according strictly to free-love or informal barter arrangement principles. While external observers often consider the Deza a psychotic mass prison or inscrutable headless post-totalitarianism, the standard of living is generally high, and Dezans report a reasonable level of satisfaction with both the material and immaterial sides of life. Critics point out, of course, that not only all education and entertainment but also all polling and statistics are produced purely by the Dezan state itself, and the argument invariably ends--or devolves from--there.",

Having long had a significant UN presence due to the Larnax Junction and consequently little need or desire for local warfleets, the successor governments on Larnax all tacitly agreed on a policy that amounted to 'duck and cover'.

Arriving more or less peacefully in the system, they quickly established themselves in the holdings they had on planet and waged a war of dominance on the planet, putting down rivaling powers on the planet until finally a semblance of order came out of the fires of chaos that had gripped the planet for decades. With the First Interstellar War having finished years ago, merchant ships had also begun to ply the routes once again. The primary reason they never really came back to Shilo was that the planet was locked in a conflict between powers. While a single governing body has yet to establish itself, the world is now stable enough that merchant ships has started to return in force. Certainly the struggle between the Trilite Conglomerate and the other powers on Shilo still exists, but they are confident enough they won't simply be accosted. It will take plenty of effort for the Conglomerate to emerge victorious, but they can see the light at the end of the tunnel now, a new Golden Age, they believe, is upon them.",

The National Assembly is that legislature, and operates as a mixed-member proportional body, with Delegates elected from individual districts and chosen from party lists. A Chief Delegate is elected by a majority of delegates, and appoints the cabinet. By tradition, most ministers are drawn from the Assembly, though it is not unusual for one or two to be drawn from outside the legislature. The right to vote is universal, and voting is mandatory, with strict limits placed on the ability for money or outside actors to influence elections. The executive is almost completely ceremonial, and consists of a President elected to a single 10-year term. The judicial branch is independent, and has the power of constitutional review over legislature and regulation.",

        "description" : "The Union is a mostly democratic entity, with its own planetary parliament known as Prezydium that consists of representatives from each Administrative District. They are known as Elektors, for this very Prezydium also elects for a period of five years a Konsul to preside over the body and perform administrative decisions as the Head of Government. That person does not enjoy total control over the executive, however. Since Novopol had been a closely overseen colony for a very long time it still maintains many meritocratic traditions and far stronger institutions that used to be the only source of law and order, and accordingly members of his or her cabinet are chosen from a pre-made list of people considered to be well experienced and competent in the relevant field. According to Novopolan beliefs, elected officials are there to give direction to the Union, one as closely resembling the wishes of its people as possible. It is competent, experienced experts and career administrators that can and shall move it in said direction, however.",

        "description" : "In the decades leading up to the collapse, tensions between America and its most far-flung colonies had nearly reached a boiling point. Citizens of what was known as the American Diaspora were sick and tired of oppressive and exploitative economic practices. Nearly a millennia after the American revolution, the second American Revolution erupted in the fires of the Disconnect. The colonies declared independence, one by one, over the course of two short months. The United States Space Force had been a paper tiger for years, albeit a large one. The rebellious colonials would have stood no chance if it were not for the simultaneous revolt of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force. While other fringe worlds dissolved into anarchy, the newly formed People’s States of America engaged in a crash-militarization program of epic proportions. Even so, the first battle of the PSA against their former colonial masters was a bloodbath. The People’s navy consisted of ramshackle escorts, barely even manned because of how shoddily constructed they were, and ore haulers with lasers and armor bolted on. The United States of America had the USSFV George Washington as the centerpiece of its fleet – a capital ship that outweighed and outgunned every single ship in the rebel navy. The US Navy shattered dozens of PSA hulls – but it wasn’t enough. Through force of numbers and sheer bloody-minded fanaticism, the newly formed Socialist state won the day. The American navy, already broken from its conflict with the UN, turned tail and headed home. And thus, from the ashes, was born a new nation. Dedicated to the principles that all men are created equal, and liberty and justice for all – for real this time.",

The locals settled with long-term self-sufficiency in mind and produced few exports, only starting to re-orient towards the outside world after recontact by nearby Stavanger. Most economic activity is based on seeding the terraces and valleys with transgenic forests that are harvested sustainably for a boutique export market, with an eye towards eventually producing great redwoods and mangrove trees that can be used to stabilize the humid, rainy lowlands of the planet's limited habitable land. The serene beauty and calm seasons drew a more introspective and less enterprising sort of colonist in early days, with including a permanent hermitage of the Society of Analytical Philosophy, followed by a number of new-age sects and self-improvement movements after the return of space travel.",

Citizens of what was known as the American Diaspora were sick and tired of oppressive and exploitative economic practices. Nearly a millennia after the American revolution, the second American Revolution erupted in the fires of the Disconnect. The colonies declared independence, one by one, over the course of two short months. The United States Space Force had been a paper tiger for years, albeit a large one. The rebellious colonials would have stood no chance if it were not for the simultaneous revolt of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force. While other fringe worlds dissolved into anarchy, the newly formed People’s States of America engaged in a crash-militarization program of epic proportions. Even so, the first battle of the PSA against their former colonial masters was a bloodbath. The People’s navy consisted of ramshackle escorts, barely even manned because of how shoddily constructed they were, and ore haulers with lasers and armor bolted on. The United States of America had the USSFV George Washington as the centerpiece of its fleet – a capital ship that outweighed and outgunned every single ship in the rebel navy. The US Navy shattered dozens of PSA hulls – but it wasn’t enough. Through force of numbers and sheer bloody-minded fanaticism, the newly formed Socialist state won the day. The American navy, already broken from its conflict with the UN, turned tail and headed home. And thus, from the ashes, was born a new nation. Dedicated to the principles that all men are created equal, and liberty and justice for all – for real this time.",

As there is no concept of \"household\" beyond state-run civic organizations at the village/complex level, nor any significant personal property or marriage, such liaisons are conducted according strictly to free-love or informal barter arrangement principles. While external observers often consider the Deza a psychotic mass prison or inscrutable headless post-totalitarianism, the standard of living is generally high, and Dezans report a reasonable level of satisfaction with both the material and immaterial sides of life. Critics point out, of course, that not only all education and entertainment but also all polling and statistics are produced purely by the Dezan state itself, and the argument invariably ends--or devolves from--there.",

For a time it worked, with Oblivia holding the title of furthest-flung colony for two or three generations. With little support its development was slow, though it did eventually become a fully independent statelet living up to modest expectations, whirling alone out in the deep frontier. It enjoyed some praise as a model colony, ruling a vast ocean of untamed worlds. As extra-solar colonization continued though, Oblivia's isolation was eroded. Colonies with more resources soon appeared nearby, outgrowing and out-competing the mature world. Trade was naturally well-received, but with commerce and population came both the unwanted attention of raiders and the United Nations. There was no longer any defence in distance alone, and the world underwent several upheavals as violence and outside politics were soon on its doorstep.",

Refusing to take even itself seriously, Outer Oblivia didn't command enough respect to be reigned in or supported by its parent world, which seemed to delight in its missteps and struggles. Its early years were marked by turmoil with radical shifts in government as it experimented with one form after another. Generations later, though, it found a footing and things changed. Where Oblivia spurned the slow encroachment of civilization on what was then the Frontier, the Supreme Ascendancy embraced it. Situated in orbit around a super-jovian world with one hundred moons and a metallic asteroid ring, Outer Oblivia had a preponderance of resources and ideal shipbuilding sites, and soon became an important industrial center and a nexus for growth as colonies expanded both around it and into the untamed expanse beyond it.",
