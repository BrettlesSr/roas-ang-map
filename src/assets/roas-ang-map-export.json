Centered around the capital city of Romi Bay and the (at the time) partially completed orbital elevator sited at the mouth of the Tantalus Chasm the future republic simply closed its borders and rode out the worst of the troubles. Having long had a significant UN presence due to the Larnax Junction and consequently little need or desire for local warfleets, the successor governments on Larnax all tacitly agreed on a policy that amounted to 'duck and cover'. While excoriated as cowards by some of the more virulent anti-UN groups, many of them were soon taking orbitally-dropped PGMs into presidential palaces.",

Despite its industrial and economic power, Azania is a state that lives and dies based on trade and access to markets. It needs to import food even with operational agricultural habitats, and needs to export finished goods and rare materials to pay for that food. The state itself, the People's Democratic Federation of Azania, is a Democratic Confederalist state of communes, wards, and stations that work together for the betterment of one another.

Citizens of what was known as the American Diaspora were sick and tired of oppressive and exploitative economic practices. Nearly a millennia after the American revolution, the second American Revolution erupted in the fires of the Disconnect. The colonies declared independence, one by one, over the course of two short months. The United States Space Force had been a paper tiger for years, albeit a large one. The rebellious colonials would have stood no chance if it were not for the simultaneous revolt of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force. While other fringe worlds dissolved into anarchy, the newly formed People’s States of America engaged in a crash-militarization program of epic proportions. Even so, the first battle of the PSA against their former colonial masters was a bloodbath. The People’s navy consisted of ramshackle escorts, barely even manned because of how shoddily constructed they were, and ore haulers with lasers and armor bolted on. The United States of America had the USSFV George Washington as the centerpiece of its fleet – a capital ship that outweighed and outgunned every single ship in the rebel navy. The US Navy shattered dozens of PSA hulls – but it wasn’t enough. Through force of numbers and sheer bloody-minded fanaticism, the newly formed Socialist state won the day. The American navy, already broken from its conflict with the UN, turned tail and headed home. And thus, from the ashes, was born a new nation. Dedicated to the principles that all men are created equal, and liberty and justice for all – for real this time.",

As there is no concept of \"household\" beyond state-run civic organizations at the village/complex level, nor any significant personal property or marriage, such liaisons are conducted according strictly to free-love or informal barter arrangement principles. While external observers often consider the Deza a psychotic mass prison or inscrutable headless post-totalitarianism, the standard of living is generally high, and Dezans report a reasonable level of satisfaction with both the material and immaterial sides of life.

This led to a brutal guerrilla war which eventually horrified the SSAR's public enough to cut their own mercenary troops free, but also caused a political crisis in many of the other Beta Continental cities as to how to deal with both marauding off-worlder and SSAR troops, and the flood of refugees created by the conflict. This in turn, resulted in the anarcho-socialist \"Councils of Workers and Intellectuals\" which had been one of the more successful intercity groups to take power, forming a state around a combination of direct, computer-aided democracy and worker and expert controlled councils. The UCCT became a major force in the defeat of the mercenaries, and in the post-war negotiation and skirmishing was able to muscle the SSAR back to ts pre-war limits.",
